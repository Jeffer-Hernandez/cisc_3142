### Exercise 4.5
> Determine the result of the following expressions.

(a) 30 * 3 + 21 / 5
`94.2`

(b) 30 + 3 * 21 / 5
`42.6`

(c) 30 / 3 * 21 % 5
`10`

(d) 30 / 3 * 21 % 4
`10`

### Exercise 4.17
> Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

`Postfix` decrement operator means the expression is evaluated first using the original value of the variable and then the variable is decremented(decreased). `Prefix` increment operator means the variable is incremented first and then the expression is evaluated using the new value of the variable.

### Exercise 4.34
> Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:

(a) if (fval)
(b) dval = fval + ival;
(c) dval + ival * cval;
